<h2>What Is Physiotherapy?</h2>
<p>The primary profession of physiotherapy helps patients to improve and maintain their physical functions and strength. They learn how to pinpoint the root cause of an injury and/or the multiple factors involved in movement dysfunction and chronic pain.</p>
<h2>What is the best time to see a physiotherapist?</h2>
<p>A physiotherapist can help you if your mobility and ability to function has changed. This could be caused by a recent injury or surgery. But physiotherapists can also help prevent injury. So instead of waiting for discomfort to change into a loss of function, you would benefit from the help of a skilled and certified manipulative physiotherapist.</p>
